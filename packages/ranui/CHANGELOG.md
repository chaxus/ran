# Changelog

All notable changes to `ranui` will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Tests

- Improved `r-player` unit coverage by adding controls, media event handler, fullscreen compatibility, interaction, and manifest level tests.
- Increased `player/index.ts` line coverage to 87.97% and overall ranui line coverage to 93.08%.
- Added coverage for player lifecycle cleanup, Hls teardown, media listener cleanup, attribute synchronization, clarity switching, seeking, volume, fullscreen, and controller interactions.

### Fixed

- Restored the remembered volume when unmuting `r-player`.
- Guarded player controller hover and progress leave handlers against events without an element target.
- Made player fullscreen helpers fall back to prefixed browser APIs when standard fullscreen APIs are unavailable.

### Changed

- Extracted player fullscreen API selection and HLS manifest level normalization into focused core helpers for easier testing.
